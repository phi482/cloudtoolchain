Cloud Tool Chain is a blog dedicated to documenting the tools I am using to get my company cloud-ready.  I plan to talk about the private cloud we are creating, a data center migration, and eventually moving workloads to the public cloud.

I am a systems engineer based in Louisville, KY that focuses mainly on virtualization and automation.  DevSecOps is a concept we are embrassing as we continue to develop more and more business critical applications.

Welcome and much more to come!
